Requirements:
1. Mosquito broker for simulation : https://mosquitto.org/download/
2. For python paho-mqtt : pip install paho-mqtt 


For initializing the broker :
1. Open command prompt/ terminal/powershell etc in administrator right.
2. Open the installation drive for mosquito default : C:\Program Files\mosquitto
3. Initialize broker using command mosquitto – v

For starting client simulating DIE publishing random data:
1. Open another terminal
2. Run the file PubDIE.py : python …\mqttHMI\ PubDIE.py
3. This will initiate endless loop of simulation of DIE message publishing
4. For HMI Subscribing data run the file main.py : python …\mqttHMI\ main.py
5. The helper functions for calling, logging, logout etc are described in SubHMIv2a.py

Changes to make for individual user:
1. Address where the recieved_messages to be saved is hard coded in SubHMIv2a.py
2. The number of messages needs to be changed based on requirement (max_messages) in SubHMIv2a.py
3. The subscription sustem is mentioned in main.py and its time based system unlike PubDIE.py 
so to adjust the time in seconds change value of abort_after variable
4. Change the messages needed for subscription by adjusting the variable topics_to_subscribe in main.py
5. For subscribing to multiple topics under a same main topic use # wildcard . eg /DCWallbox/HMI/ChargingProgressPage/#
